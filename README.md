# VVMACS
An Emacs distro that aims to have the efficiency of Vim with the user-friendliness of VSCode.

Emacs is a **not** a text editor, it is a fully featured enviroment for Elisp code. It just happens to be able to edit text. As such, it allows for customization and extensibility far beyond the likes of VSCode and even Vim.

However, one of the biggest downsides of emacs is it's steep learning curve, the language used to customize Emacs is difficult and it's syntax is quite strange. This makes Emacs quite daunting to new users, who'd rather stick with their limiting toolkit rather than spend weeks or months learning Emacs.

This config aims to ease the transition for new users looking to join the Church of Emacs by changing the annoying features and adding the ones that most people looking to start using Emacs would want, while remaining lightweight and straightforward enough to not seem daunting to new users.

But one of the best parts of this configuration for new users is the fact that it is written in Org Mode, the Markdown-like file format native to Emacs. This allows for detailed explanations of each tweak and package installed along with an easy way to navigate the file.
